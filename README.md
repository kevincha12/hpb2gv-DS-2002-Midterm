# hpb2gv-DS-2002-Midterm
This is my midterm solution for DS-2002 converting various data sources to a nice OLAP database.

# Installation and Requirements
Note that you WILL need the sakila sample dataset available at: https://dataedo.com/kb/databases/mysql/sample-databases
It also seems to come default with an installation of MySQL workbench.

Furthermore, you WILL need the code from Lab 2c to create the dim_date tables. If you do not, this code will NOT work.

Once you have done that, changing the values of the MySQL login instance and the MongoDB cluster information should allow you to run the code yourself. The remainder of the code should work as I have tested and re-ran it to ensure proper functionality, as well as authored two SQL queries to make sure that it is effective.

# Contact
Please contact me at hpb2gv@virginia.edu if there are any issues with this repository. I would be happy to answer any questions regarding my design choices and whatnot, although the majority of the comments I provided should be able to explain my thought process in creating the OLAP database.

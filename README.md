# hpb2gv-DS-2002-Midterm
This is my midterm solution for DS-2002 converting various data sources to a nice OLAP database.

Please contact me at hpb2gv@virginia.edu if there are any issues with this repository. I would be happy to answer any questions regarding my design choices and whatnot, although the majority of the comments I provided should be able to explain my thought process in creating the OLAP database.
